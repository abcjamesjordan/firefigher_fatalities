# Firefigher Fatalities

This dataset is from the U.S. Fire Administration that tracked firefighter fatalities from 1990 to present day.

Basic data analysis is done on this dataset to attempt to better understand the potential and likely dangers a firefighter faces on a daily basis. In addition, this work was also done to serve as a demonstration of my (James Jordan) data analytics capabilities as I am currently job searching.
